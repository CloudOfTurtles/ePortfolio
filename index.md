# Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a strong foundation of technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and professional values that have prepared me to enter the field as a capable and adaptable software developer. Building this ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on my progression from early coursework to the advanced concepts demonstrated in my final artifacts. The process showed how my strengths in software design, algorithms, databases, communication, and security have grown into a cohesive professional identity.

## Collaboration and Communication
Across multiple courses, I learned the importance of clear communication and effective collaboration. Through creating system requirement documents, UML diagrams, and technical explanations, I gained experience translating stakeholder needs into actionable designs. Even in individual projects, I communicated through documentation, diagrams, comments, and presentations, including the video code review in this portfolio.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
Courses such as CS-260 and CS-370 strengthened my understanding of algorithmic principles and data-structure-driven problem solving. The Pirate Maze AI artifact demonstrates my ability to apply search algorithms, evaluate efficiency, and improve computational logic. Enhancing this artifact reinforced my understanding of algorithm efficiency and scalability.

## Software Engineering and Databases
The DriverPass artifact represents my early experience with system design, requirements modeling, and the software development lifecycle. Enhancing it strengthened my engineering discipline and design decision making.

Travlr Getaways is my most technically advanced artifact, demonstrating full-stack development with Angular, Express, and MongoDB. Enhancements improved code structure, API design, database schema quality, and security considerations.

## Security Mindset
Security awareness became a consistent element of my work. Whether validating data, strengthening architecture, or defending against misuse, I learned to approach development with a preventative mindset. The enhancement process required me to reconsider earlier work through a security-focused lens.

## Professional Growth
This ePortfolio highlights the technical and professional skills I have gained, including full-stack development, object-oriented design, data management, algorithmic reasoning, and secure coding. Completing the capstone reinforced my readiness to contribute meaningfully in professional software development environments.
